Project: ddw-docker-gway
Associated Projects: ddw-docker-dbase

This project is in response to several requests from DDW users that the learning curve of that system was a bit steep. So in the Docker version of DDW we take a more modular and turn-key approach. There is one Docker (ddw-docker-dbase) that hosts the main Postgresql dbase that the DDW gatways will send their results to. There will be another companion Docker (ddw-docker-gway) that will bundle MIRTH as a service, pointing its results to ddw-dbase. 

Purpose:
This is the MIRTH gway (one of N) that gets DICOM studies, parses their headers and sends selected data to the DDW PostgreSQL running on the Docker ddw-dbase

Herein are the following ddw-dbase components
a) Dockerfile 		    (the main build file for the docker)
b) mirthdb.sql 	      (stub schema for MIRTH to connect to on Postgres)
c) service-start.sh 	(for provisioning the docker)
d) run_ddw_db.sh	    (a convenience script for automating the build/run/provision cycle)
e) mirth.properties.psql  (to replace the default Mirth reliance on Derby and point to Postgres)
f) this README

Outstanding work items Sept 2016:
a) mirth still not autheticating to postgresql
b) then have to get ddw-gw talking to ddw-db
